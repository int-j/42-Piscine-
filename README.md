# 42-Piscine 

Welcome onboard dear pisciners,

The purpose of sharing the code here is to LEARN and UNDERSTAND your peers' code, not to COPY IT!
Understand it, then rewrite it or write your own version that makes the most sense to you~ 

My advice is to learn as much as possible, exchange ideas with as many pisciners as you can (DO NOT UNDERSTIMATE YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE), and have fun!

Good luck üí™üèª
